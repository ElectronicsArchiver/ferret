Ferret is a free software lisp implementation designed to be used in
real time embedded control systems. Ferret lisp compiles down to self
contained *C++11*. Generated code is portable between any Operating
System and/or Microcontroller that supports a *C++11* compliant
compiler. It has been verified to run on architectures ranging from
embedded systems with as little as *2KB of RAM* to general purpose
computers running Linux/Mac OS X/Windows.

This repository contains the Ferret compiler. For more information about Ferret, 
including downloads and documentation for the latest release, check
